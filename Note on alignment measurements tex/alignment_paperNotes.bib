@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The mylar plate Q1L outer was also excluded from this calculation, as the comparison between VCNL4010 and the laser scan was most inconsistent there. This may be due to the sensors not sampling the wavy mylar accurately, or perhaps the mylar plate was most modified relative to the laser scan when its cage was inserted to the chamber. Either way we are justified to exclude this plate."}
