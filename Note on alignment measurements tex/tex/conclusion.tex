\section{\label{sec:conc} Conclusion}
\medskip


A significant effort was invested over years and by several people towards a precise determination of the EQS plates alignment.
The rich laser scan dataset, corroborated and amended by the in situ surveys performed over the 2018 shutdown, combine into our best estimation for the plate positions listed in Table~\ref{tab:PlatePositions}.
Comparison between the independent surveys yields also an estimation of the uncertainty of each plate's location, which is fairly small given the difficulty of testing the assumptions of the laser scan dataset and accessing the system in situ.
